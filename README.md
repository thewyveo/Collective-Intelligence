## Collective Intelligence
This repository was forked from the original repository OlgaPiestrak/Collective-Intelligence-Project.
This repository is based on the collective intelligence course, and was devised over a month, with three assignments (of increasing complexity).
The implementations use Violet, a library built on top of PyGame. The final assignment, A2, contains a final report.
ALL WORK IN THIS REPOSITORY AND IN THE ORIGINAL REPOSITORY ARE DONE BY THE AUTHORS IN THE FINAL REPORT PAPER (ME, AND 4 OTHERS) - the existance of this repository is only for public display on my profile, of the work we've done over a month with my group.

# Getting Started
[Violet](https://github.com/m-rots/violet) is built on top of the latest and greatest Python features such as type hints, generics and dataclasses.
Therefore, you need to have the latest version of Python installed: Python 3.13 or later.

The easiest way of installing the latest version of Python, as well as creating a virtual environment, is by installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once installed, simply run the following command to run the code:

```sh
uv run flocking.py
```
