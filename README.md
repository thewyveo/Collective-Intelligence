## Getting Started

[Violet](https://github.com/m-rots/violet) is built on top of the latest and greatest Python features such as type hints, generics and dataclasses.
Therefore, you need to have the latest version of Python installed: Python 3.13 or later.

The easiest way of installing the latest version of Python, as well as creating a virtual environment, is by installing [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).

Once installed, simply run the following command to run the code:

```sh
uv run flocking.py
```
